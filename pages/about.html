          <h3>IN THE BEGINNING</h3>
          <p>
            As the holidays approached in 1848, the atmosphere on the Miami
            University campus in Oxford, Ohio was gloomy and uncertain. This was
            the mood in which Robert Morrison suggested to a close friend and
            classmate, John McMillan Wilson, that they consider putting together
            a new collegiate brotherhood. Morrison and Wilson sought out
            underclassman that they believed they would be dedicated to their
            cause. Juniors John Wolfe Lindley and Robert Thompson Drake were
            approached, as were sophomores Ardivan Walker Rodgers and Andrew
            Watts Rogers, all of whom accepted the concept. All six men were
            among the group of Miami students who did not attempt to go home to
            join their families for the holidays. Winter travel conditions were
            difficult and could often prove perilous due to harsh winter
            conditions. The need for close companionship was evident when the
            six met the night of December 26, 1848 in Wilson's second floor room
            in Old North Hall. They firmed up their desire to establish a
            brotherhood. They met two nights later in the same room to consider
            an appropriate motto and constitution - The Bond of the Phi Delta
            Theta. This is the same Bond that every initiate into the Phi Delta
            Theta Fraternity has since signed. On December 30, the “Immortal
            Six” put their signatures to The Bond of the Phi Delta Theta. Their
            names remain a vital part of the rituals that continue today in
            every chapter room across the United States and Canada. The Bond has
            remained unchanged from that day to this.

          <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
          <p>
            Phi Delta Theta was built on three pillars that haven't budged an
            inch since the Fraternity was founded by “The Immortal Six” way back
            in 1848 at Miami University. The pillars are: The cultivation of
            friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high
            degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high
            standard of morality. Shortened, we refer to the principles as
            Friendship, Sound Learning, and Rectitude. Helping every individual
            to meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta
            Fraternity. By celebrating each person's true self, and by learning
            from each other's strengths while helping to improve each other's
            weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater
            version of himself than he could ever on his own. Rather than try to
            find young men to “mold” into some ideal, we celebrate the
            uniqueness of each individual and, through encouragement, values,
            example and brotherhood, empower every brother to exceed his
            personal expectations.
          </p>
          <h3>TODAY</h3>
          <p>
            Today, Phi Delta Theta is approaching 200 chapters, has
            approximately 178,000 living alumni, and boasts 100 alumni clubs in
            the United States and Canada. The Fraternity operates from the
            General Headquarters building on South Campus Avenue, across from
            Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

          <h3>ABOUT THE CHAPTER</h3>
          <p>
            The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity was founded in 1848 by 6 young men at
            Miami University of Ohio, upon the pillars of moral rectitude, sound
            learning and the cultivation of friendship between its members. The
            organization's focus has been to help its members become "the best
            version of themselves" long-term celebrating the uniqueness of each
            member rather than forcing members to conform to some model or
            standard. This Fraternity re-established a chapter on Allegheny's
            campus in early 2000's and has been steadily growing since.
