            At the heart of the Phi Delta Theta experience is the opportunity to
            build family on campus, learn valuable skills not taught in the
            classroom, and position yourself for future success.

        <h3>THE PHI DELTA THETA FRATERNITY</h3>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity was founded in 1848 by 6 young
                men at Miami University of Ohio, upon the pillars of moral
                rectitude, sound learning and the cultivation of friendship
                between its members. The organization's focus has been to help
                its members become "the best version of themselves" long-term
                celebrating the uniqueness of each member rather than forcing
                members to conform to some model or standard.  This Fraternity
                re-established a chapter on Allegheny's campus in early 2000's
                and has been steadily growing since.

          <p>
            Great friendships are a crucial component of living well, and Phi
            Delta Theta challenges its members to create long-term and
            meaningful relationships with each other.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <img src="../assets/images/cardinal-principles/sound_learning.png">
          <p>
            Sound learning is much more than getting good grades. It's about
            intellectual curiosity and the search for truth. It's about
            well-roundedness and becoming cultured in all aspects of life.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <img src="../assets/images/cardinal-principles/rectitude.png" />
          <p>
            Rectitude has more to do with the way one approaches living and less
            with observing dos and don'ts. A commitment to rectitude is a
            consistent demand to act responsibly and lovingly during one's
            college days and throughout life.
