      <h3>PA DELTA'S PHILANTHROPIC EFFORT</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Our chapter contributes to Live Like Lou through various projects and
          philanthropic events, some of which are collaborative with other
          organizations on campus. This past November, our brothers participated
          in a 2 day long "Fire and Ice" event. Inspired by the "ALS Ice Bucket
          Challenge", our brothers were soaked in buckets of ice water and drank
          hot sauce for Live Like Lou!
        </p>
        <p>
          This past spring, our chapter hosted another pottery sale in
          collaboration with the Clay Club on campus! Brothers worked with
          members of the Clay Club over the past semester to make mugs, bowls
          and more by hand. These pieces were sold and the proceeds were split
          between Live Like Lou and the local Meadville Soup Kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the contributions to Live Like Lou, our chapter works to
          better our larger Meadville Community. Our chapter has frequently
          worked with Tamarack Wildlife Center to help clean and upkeep their
          facilities. We contribute to annual service events hosted by the
          College and actively participate and contribute to other
          organization's philanthropic endeavors to advance their causes as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Fall, PA Delta is undertaking the formidable task of becoming an
          "Iron Phi Chapter", raising a total of $10,000 for LiveLikeLou in
          addition to each participating brother planning and executing a
          physical challenge of their choosing.

      <h3>IRON PHI CHAPTER</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          According to their website, the Iron Phi program is described as:
          "...a way to strengthen both Phi Delta Theta and its impact on the
          fight against Lou Gehrig's disease. Through the fundraising efforts of
          participants on the way to achieving personal athletic goals, Iron Phi
          is creating a community of philanthropists who hope to Leave ALS
          Better Than They Found It.
        </p>
        <p>
          To become an Iron Phi, participants must select an athletic endeavor
          of their choice, raise $1,000 through the Iron Phi website, and
          accomplish the athletic endeavor itself."
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone is able to take on the Iron Phi Challenge: undergraduates,
          alumni, friends of the chapter or just ALS advocates! You can find out
          more at the link
