        <h1>BECOME THE GREATEST VERSION OF YOURSELF</h1>
        <p>
          Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of
          the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person's true
          self, and by learning from each other's strengths while helping to
          improve each other's weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta
          develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his
          own. Rather than try to find young men to “mold” into some ideal, we
          celebrate the uniqueness of each individual and, through
          encouragement, values, example and brotherhood, empower every brother
          to exceed his personal expectations. Phi Delta Theta's goal is to be
          the premier fraternal leadership organization in the world. We want
          those who enjoy leading to join our organization, and we are committed
          to furthering each member's leadership potential. Alongside each
          member are brothers who become an instant family at college; a family
          that encourages, guides, and supports each other through the ups and
          downs of life.
