				<h2>BECOME THE GREATEST VERSION OF YOURSELF</h2>
				<p>
					Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of
					the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person's true
					self, and by learning from each other's strengths while helping to
					improve each other's weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta
					develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his
					own. Rather than try to find young men to “mold” into some ideal, we
					celebrate the uniqueness of each individual and, through
					encouragement, values, example and brotherhood, empower every brother
					to exceed his personal expectations. Phi Delta Theta's goal is to be
					the premier fraternal leadership organization in the world. We want
					those who enjoy leading to join our organization, and we are committed
					to furthering each member's leadership potential. Alongside each
					member are brothers who become an instant family at college; a family
					that encourages, guides, and supports each other through the ups and
					downs of life.

					<img src="../images/crest.png" /> Phi Delta Theta was built on three
					pillars that haven't budged an inch since the Fraternity was founded
					by “The Immortal Six” way back in 1848 at Miami University. The
					pillars are: The cultivation of friendship among its members, the
					acquirement individually of a high degree of mental culture, and the
					attainment personally of a high standard of morality. Shortened, we
					refer to these Cardinal Principles as Friendship, Sound Learning, and
					Rectitude.
