      <h3>WHY PHI DELTA THETA?</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of
          the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person's true
          self, and by learning from each other's strengths while helping to
          improve each other's weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta
          develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his
          own. Rather than try to find young men to mold into some ideal, we
          celebrate the uniqueness of each individual and, through
          encouragement, values, example and brotherhood, empower every brother
          to exceed his personal expectations.

      <div class="content">
        <div class="card">
          <img src="assets/images/cardinal-principles/friendship.png" />
          <p>
            Great friendships are a crucial component of living well, and Phi
            Delta Theta challenges its members to create long-term and
            meaningful relationships with each other.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <img src="assets/images/cardinal-principles/sound_learning.png" />
          <p>
            Sound learning is much more than getting good grades. It's about
            intellectual curiosity and the search for truth. It's about
            well-roundedness and becoming cultured in all aspects of life.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <img src="assets/images/cardinal-principles/rectitude.png" />
          <p>
            Rectitude has more to do with the way one approaches living and less
            with observing dos and don'ts. A commitment to rectitude is a
            consistent demand to act responsibly and lovingly during one's
            college days and throughout life.
