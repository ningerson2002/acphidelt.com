				<h2>IN THE BEGINNING</h2>
				<p>
					As the holidays approached in 1848, the atmosphere on the Miami
					University campus in Oxford, Ohio was gloomy and uncertain. This was
					the mood in which Robert Morrison suggested to a close friend and
					classmate, John McMillan Wilson, that they consider putting together a
					new collegiate brotherhood. Morrison and Wilson sought out
					underclassman that they believed they would be dedicated to their
					cause. Juniors John Wolfe Lindley and Robert Thompson Drake were
					approached, as were sophomores Ardivan Walker Rodgers and Andrew Watts
					Rogers, all of whom accepted the concept. All six men were among the
					group of Miami students who did not attempt to go home to join their
					families for the holidays. Winter travel conditions were difficult and
					could often prove perilous due to harsh winter conditions. The need
					for close companionship was evident when the six met the night of
					December 26, 1848 in Wilson's second floor room in Old North Hall.
					They firmed up their desire to establish a brotherhood. They met two
					nights later in the same room to consider an appropriate motto and
					constitution - The Bond of the Phi Delta Theta. This is the same Bond
					that every initiate into the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity has since
					signed. On December 30, the “Immortal Six” put their signatures to The
					Bond of the Phi Delta Theta. Their names remain a vital part of the
					rituals that continue today in every chapter room across the United
					States and Canada. The Bond has remained unchanged from that day to
					this.

				<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
				<p>
					Phi Delta Theta was built on three pillars that haven't budged an inch
					since the Fraternity was founded by “The Immortal Six” way back in
					1848 at Miami University. The pillars are: The cultivation of
					friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high
					degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high
					standard of morality. Shortened, we refer to the principles as
					Friendship, Sound Learning, and Rectitude. Helping every individual to
					meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta
					Fraternity. By celebrating each person's true self, and by learning
					from each other's strengths while helping to improve each other's
					weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater
					version of himself than he could ever on his own. Rather than try to
					find young men to “mold” into some ideal, we celebrate the uniqueness
					of each individual and, through encouragement, values, example and
					brotherhood, empower every brother to exceed his personal
					expectations.
				</p>
				<h2>TODAY</h2>
				<p>
					Today, Phi Delta Theta is approaching 200 chapters, has approximately
					178,000 living alumni, and boasts 100 alumni clubs in the United
					States and Canada. The Fraternity operates from the General
					Headquarters building on South Campus Avenue, across from Miami
					University in Oxford, Ohio.
